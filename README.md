# AtomicBrowser
A privacy browser that blocks tracking and ads, and has a private browsing with Tor
It uses Google SafeBrowsing to check URLs before going to them, and it also has recently been optimized for speed by 
loading JavaScript now with JSv8, slight mem caching, and the ability to send multiple http requests in a single request.

Not complete as I am adding additional functionality to it.
